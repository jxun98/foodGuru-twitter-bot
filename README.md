# foodGuru-twitter-bot

## Intro
Hi there! This is just a little Twitter bot that I decided to code up in my spare time, it replies to your tweets with food recommendations and can make food selections for you if presented with a list of options. If you ask for a food recommendation it will respond alliterative-ly with the day of the week! Go tweet at it @FoodGuruBot (hopefully it'll be up and running hahaha)! It is currently being hosted on Heroku.

## Comands

The bot currently accepts two types of tweets as commands:

### Food Recommendation

If you'd like to ask for an alliterative food recommendation, send FoodGuruBot a tweet that starts with 'I'm hungry'.

Eg.
I'm hungry!
I'm hungry...
I'm hungry?
I'm hungry, pick something!

### Food Pick

If you'd like to ask FoodGuruBot to pick a food for you (let's say you can't decide between Chipotle, Taco Bell, or Bueno Nacho), you can send it the following tweet and the bot will make a selection for you!

Eg.
Pick one: Chipotle, Taco Bell, Bueno Nacho.

## Notes
Please note that you must directly tweet at FoodGuruBot (tweets must begin with @FoodGuruBot). Tweets that only mention FoodGuruBot will not trigger a response (eg. having the mention at the end of the tweet).
